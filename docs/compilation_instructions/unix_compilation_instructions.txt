This file contains instructions for installing Spatial Metric Calculator alongside its dependencies on 
Unix-like systems (i.e. MacOS + Linux)


DISCLAIMER: 

The instructions for installing Spatial Metric Calculator's dependencies are *examples guides* and should not be
treated as official guidance for those pieces of software. Always check with the appropriate sources (listed below) 
for the appropriate installation method on your machine and any preferences you wish to specify in the process.

1. Linux based systems

1.0. CMAKE

To install Spatial Metric Calcular you first need a working copy of CMake. CMake is a cross platform set of tools for 
building software natively based on universal instruction scripts. By installing CMake on the 'CmakeLists.txt' file 
in the repository can be used to build Spatial Metric Calculator.

It is highly likely your Linux distribution already has a copy of CMake, but if not, it can easily be installed 
through your package manager using, for example, the command

	>$: sudo apt install cmake

or

	>$: sudo yum install cmake

for Debian or Fedora based distributions, respectively.

Alternatively one can install CMake in either source or binary form from https://cmake.org/download/. 
For more information see https://cmake.org/.

1.1 Boost

A dependency of Spatial Metric Calculator is Boost which provides C++ libraries for various low level functionality.

The easiest way to install Boost is through your package manager. Assuming a Debian distribution this would, for 
example, be achieved through the command

	>$ sudo apt install libboost-all-dev

Alternatively, one can download the source directly from https://www.boost.org/users/download/. A detailed 
walk through of an installation can be found at https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/more/getting_started/. 
A concise, "simple case", is shown below.

Once extracted, navigate to the extracted Boost directory, then, assuming a default installation to /usr/local/, 
Boost can then typically be installed by the following commands

	>$ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local
	>$ sudo ./b2 install

These commands may take some time.

Note: the CMakeLists.txt file will stop and indicate an error if only an earlier version of Boost than v1.77 is 
availiable. This version is required to open the bundled example .proj files. If this is too restrictive you can 
edit the line containing `find_package(Boost 1.77 REQUIRED COMPONENTS date_time serialization)` and adjust 1.77 
to the version available to you. Please note that if you do so the build of Spatial Metric Calculator that you 
compile may not be able to open .proj files produced by other copies of Spatial Metric Calculator.

1.2 FLTK

A dependency of Spatial Metric Calculator is FLTK which provides cross platform GUI functionality. You can download 
either the current development snapshot from https://github.com/fltk/fltk, or the latest stable release (v1.3.7 at 
time of writing) from https://www.fltk.org/software.php (recommended).

FLTK must be built with CMake for a successful build of Spatial Metric Calculator. To do so, extract the FLTK 
download and navigate into the directory. FLTK can the be installed with the following commands

	>$ mkdir build
	>$ cd build
	>$ cmake ..
	>$ make
	>$ sudo make install

For more information see the README_CMake.txt file in the FLTK directory and/or see https://www.fltk.org/.

1.3

Once these dependencies are installed, Spatial Metric Calculator can be built by navigating to the repository 
and then entering the commands

	>$ mkdir build
	>$ cd build
	>$ cmake ..
	>$ make

An executable file "Spatial-Metric-Calculator" will be built in the newly created build directory.

2. MacOS systems

2.0 Developer tools (Clang etc.)

If you do not have a C++ compiler, or if you are unsure, you can install the Apple developer command line tools 
with the command

	>$ xcode-select â€”install

2.1. CMAKE

To install Spatial Metric Calcular you first need a working copy of CMake. CMake is a cross platform set of tools for 
building software natively based on universal instruction scripts. By installing CMake on the 'CmakeLists.txt' file 
in the repository can be used to build Spatial Metric Calculator.

This can easily be installed through homebrew (https://brew.sh/) through the command

	>$: brew install cmake

Alternatively one can obtain CMake in .dmg form from https://cmake.org/download/. Once the .dmg is downloaded you 
can install it by 
	
	1. Double clicking the downloaded .dmg file to initially install it. 
	2. In the window that pops up, drag the CMake icon into the Application folder.
	3. Add the following line to your shell profile file. (E.g. this might be your .profile file found in 
	   /Users/your_user_name/ [You can create it if it doesn't exist]. Note the "." at the start of the filename.)

		export PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin":"$PATH"

	4. Reload your .profile file (or equivalent) with the command

		>$ source ~/.profile

	   Adapt as necessary.

For more information see https://cmake.org/.

2.4

Once these dependencies are installed, Spatial Metric Calculator can be built by navigating to the repository 
and then entering the commands

	>$ mkdir build
	>$ cd build
	>$ cmake ..
	>$ make

A MacOS app bundle "Spatial-Metric-Calculator.app" will be built in the newly created build directory. This can be 
moved into your Applications folder, or anywhere else, if desired.
